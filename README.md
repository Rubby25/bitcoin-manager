# Bitcoin Manager

A decentralized blockchain platform for managing Bitcoin-related financial operations, subscriptions, and analytics on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Bitcoin Manager provides a comprehensive solution for tracking, managing, and optimizing Bitcoin-related financial activities. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparent, secure, and immutable record-keeping while offering powerful analytics and automation features.

## Core Features

- Bitcoin subscription tracking
- Automated payment processing
- Advanced financial analytics
- Multi-token payment support
- Usage tracking and insights
- Budget management for Bitcoin services

## Architecture

The platform consists of three core smart contracts:

### 1. Bitcoin Subscription Handler
- Manages Bitcoin-related service subscriptions
- Handles registration, updates, and status management
- Supports multiple billing cycles

### 2. Payment Orchestrator
- Processes Bitcoin and crypto payments
- Supports manual and automated payment workflows
- Implements payment thresholds and approval mechanisms

### 3. Financial Analytics Engine
- Provides spending analysis for Bitcoin services
- Generates optimization recommendations
- Tracks usage patterns and spending trends

## Smart Contract Functions

### Subscription Management
```clarity
;; Register a new Bitcoin-related subscription
(register-bitcoin-subscription 
  (service-name (string-ascii 100))
  (payment-amount uint)
  (billing-cycle uint)
  (next-payment-date uint))

;; Update Bitcoin subscription details
(update-bitcoin-subscription
  (subscription-id uint)
  (service-name (string-ascii 100))
  (payment-amount uint)
  (billing-cycle uint)
  (next-payment-date uint))
```

### Payment Processing
```clarity
;; Process a Bitcoin payment
(process-bitcoin-payment 
  (subscription-id uint)
  (payment-amount uint))

;; Configure Bitcoin auto-payment settings
(configure-bitcoin-autopay 
  (enabled bool)
  (max-payment-threshold uint)
  (requires-approval bool))
```

### Analytics Functions
```clarity
;; Get Bitcoin spending analysis
(get-bitcoin-spending-overview (user principal))

;; Generate Bitcoin service optimization suggestions
(generate-bitcoin-service-recommendations)
```

## Getting Started
